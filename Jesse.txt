Jesse, 29 - “The Public Sector Intrapreneur”
Jesse is a passionate public servant that never thought he would end up in local government, but sees tons of potential and likes the challenge of changing the system. He has many great ideas about how to improve everything from public engagement to office software systems, but he needs case studies to make a case for these ideas to his supervisors.
