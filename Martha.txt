Martha, 45 - “The Community Organizer”
Martha has been working in the nonprofit world for two decades. She knows what it takes to build an engaged community around a cause, but struggles to understand how to translate those skills to the right online tools for a changing demographic. She knows the Internet has potential, but she’s wasted a lot of time on various tools in the past and needs guidance and inspiration in the form of concrete examples.
